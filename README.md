# Khalida's Data Science Projects
My projects are mostly focused on prediction analysis in both supervised and unsupervised learning. I put much effort in finding good metric scores that help me provide insights. Click on the project names to view them.

# [Netflix Recommendation System](https://github.com/kshuravi/Netflix_Recommendation_Model/blob/main/Netflix_Recommendation_Model.ipynb)
* Content based recommendation system using TF-IDF, CountVectorizor & Cosine Similarity

# [SQL Covid-19 Report](https://github.com/kshuravi/SQL_Covid_19_Report/blob/main/SQL_Covid_19_Report.ipynb)
* Exploratory analysis of Covid-19 spread in Toronto by using SQL, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

# [Churn Probability Prediction](https://github.com/kshuravi/Credit_Card_Churn_Prediction/blob/main/Churn_Probability_Prediction.ipynb)
* Finding out existing customersâ€™ probability to churn their accounts by using Random Forest with the highest accuracy score among four other models. Providing possible solutions to improve customer retention process

# [Mobile Price Classification](https://github.com/kshuravi/Mobile_Price_Classification/blob/main/Mobile_Price_Classification.ipynb)
* Use of Clustering and Classification algorithms to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc). Comparison of the accuracy scores and ROC curves are shown

# [Marvel vs DC Films EDA](https://github.com/kshuravi/Marvel_vs_DC_Film_EDA/blob/main/Marvel_vs_DC_Film_EDA.ipynb)
* Exploratory Data Analysis focused on webscraping and some sweet findings!


# [Oscar Nomination Prediction](https://github.com/kshuravi/Oscar_Nomination_Prediction_Model/blob/main/Oscar_Nomination_Prediction.ipynb)
* Using Decision Tree Classification Model, predicting Marvel and DC Films getting Oscar Nominations based on their ratings. Searching for other factors affecting the outcome


# [Digimon Data Challenge](https://github.com/kshuravi/Digimon_Challenge_Khalida/blob/main/Digimon_Challenge_Khalida.ipynb)
* Exploratory data analysis from Digimon Game Database to find out the best ratio of attack power with representation of skills, types and stages using scatterplot, barplot and countplot.
